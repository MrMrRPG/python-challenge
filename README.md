# python-challenge
This is the submittion of Joshua Ng's python-challenge for UCI's Data Bootcamp. Review instructions the below for how to use this program.

## Instructions
1. There is a main.py file in both `PyBank` and `PyPoll` folders. Use your terminal or command line and update your directory to where each of the main.py files are. For your convenience, open your command line to the directory where this README.md file is stored, then copy and paste the following line: 
```
cd PyBank
```
or
```
cd PyPoll
```
2. Once you are at the directories where the main.py files are stored, run the files with python with the command:
```
py main.py
```
3. Once the command is executed, the results should be displayed on your command line. A copy of the result is included in the `analysis` folder in both `PyBank` and `PyRoll`.
4. Once one of the main.py script has ran, proceed to the other folder and repeat from step 2 onwards.
